                    <h1>Ramdan<br>Kareem</h1>
                    <p>Ramadan, the ninth month of the Muslim calendar, is one of the most sacred times for
                         Muslims. It is the month in which it is believed that the Holy Qur'an was sent down
                          from heaven "as a guidance for men and women, a declaration of direction, and a means
                           of salvation."During this month, Muslims observe a strict fast from dawn until sunset.
                            They are not allowed to eat or drink (even water) during daylight hours. Fasting is a
                             private act of worship bringing about nearness to God, as well as a form of spiritual 
                             discipline and a means to empathize with those less fortunate. The fast is broken at the end
                              of the day with prayer and a festive meal called an iftar. It is customary to visit family and
                               friends following the iftar.</p>
